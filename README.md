# ToDo App

A simple full-stack ToDo application with separate backend and frontend services, orchestrated with Docker Compose. This project allows you to manage tasks with a user-friendly interface, and it leverages Docker to simplify development and deployment.

## Features

- **Task Management:** Create, read, update, and delete to-do items.
- **Full-stack Architecture:** A dedicated backend service for API handling and a React-based frontend for the user interface.
- **Dockerized Environment:** Easy setup and deployment using Docker Compose.
- **PostgreSQL Database:** Stores tasks and persists data using a Postgres container.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Built from the code in the `backend` directory (likely Node.js/Express, check the code for specific details).
- **Frontend:** Built from the code in the `frontend` directory (a React application using environment variables like `REACT_APP_API_URL`).
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 15, pre-configured with initialization SQL (see `./backend/database.sql`).

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) (v20.10 or later)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (v1.27 or later)
- Git

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the application locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SpAwNnScode/todoo-app.git
   cd todoo-app


2. **Run Docker Compose

Build and run all services (backend, frontend, and PostgreSQL):

docker-compose up --build

Backend Service:

PORT: Port on which the backend server runs (default is 3000).
DATABASE_URL: Connection string for the PostgreSQL database.

Frontend Service:

REACT_APP_API_URL: URL for the backend API (set to http://backend:3000 for internal Docker networking).
Feel free to modify these variables or the Docker Compose configuration as needed.

Development
Backend
Navigate to the backend directory.
Install dependencies and run the server locally (if you prefer not to use Docker during development).
Frontend
Navigate to the frontend directory.
Install dependencies using npm install or yarn install and run the development server with npm start or yarn start.
Note: When running locally outside Docker, make sure to update the API URL in the frontend to match your backendâ€™s address.
